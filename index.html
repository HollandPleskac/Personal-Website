        <p class="about-p">Hi, my name is Holland Pleskac and I am a developer and entrepreneur based in the Bay Area. I love to code
            and develop projects in my free time and I would love to be apart of the Computer Science Industry. I am
            currently a student at Mountain House High School. My skills include mobile development, cloud integration
            with Firestore, and UI/UX development. I have attended 10+ Hackathons and have placed in the majority of
            them. I am a cofounder of Xeon Developers, a software tech solutions company based in California. I am also
            a cofounder of Class Vibes, a platform that improves communication between students and teachers. </p>
